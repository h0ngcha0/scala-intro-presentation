| \gIdeology War?

/\bðŸ˜  \s

--
\**\s We want \ymodularity\s and \yreusability\s

--
\**\s Ability to split code into small modules and put them back
  together in a different way (Unix philosophy \bðŸ’¯ \s).

--
\**\s OOP and FP both provide a set of abstractions to achieve that.

--
\**\s No silver bullet (\b\_https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet\s\s)

---
\gPlan

\**\s What OOP and FP have offered when it comes to modularity and resusability

\**\s Some of the features that Scala offers to contribute to that goal.

\**\s Examples of how Scala implements FP on top of OOP

\**\s Why we \rðŸ’š \s Scala

---
\gObject Oriented Programming

/\b-\s

--
\**\s Based on the concept of \yobjects\s.

--
\**\s \yObjects\s usually contain data (\yattributes\s) and code (\ymethods\s).

--
\**\s \yMethods\s can get/set \yattributes\s within an \yobject\s.

--
\**\s Programs are made out of \yobjects\s interacting with each other.

---
\gOOP's take on modularity and reusability

/\b-\s

--
\**\s \yObjects\s encapsulate complex internal structures (\yopaque\s
  \ydata types\s) and interact with each other using \ymessage passing\s.

--
\**\s Combine \yobjects\s with \yinheritance\s, \yobject composition\s,
  \ydelegation\s

--
\**\s Subtype polymorphism (seperation of concerns)

---
\gFunctional Programming

/\b-\s

--
\**\s Emphasize on \ypure functions\s (\yreferential transparency\s)

--
\**\s Promote simple and \yimmutable\s data structures (primitive data
  types and \yalgibraic data types\s)

--
\**\s Aim for writing large piece of side effects free code by composing
  pure functions.

--
\**\s Side effects are preferrably pushed as outmost as possible.

---
\gFP's take on modularity and reusability

/\b-\s

--
\**\s \yPure functions\s over simple data types are building blocks of
  the programs written in functional style.

--
\**\s No side effects meaning that those blocks are independent of
  each other, making it easy to combine them together.

--
\**\s First class / higher order functions are the super glues that
  enables function composition.

--
\**\s Reusable in the concurrent settings.

---
\g A simple example of function composition:

/\b-\s

--
```
def lowerCase(s: String) = s.filter(c => c.isLower)
```
--
```
def count(s: String) = s.length
```
--
```
def lowerCaseCount = count _ compose lowerCase _
```

--
```
lowerCaseCount("aBc")
```

---
\gCompare OOP and FP's attempts to modularity and reusability

/\b-\s

--
\**\s Pure functions over simple data structures compose better than
  objects because objects are opaque data types that could be mutable.

--
\**\s OOP shines in domains where problems can be natually modelled as
  objects (w/o mutable states). e.g. GUI?, Actors (Erlang, Akka)

--
\**\s Still, suprisingly many problems can be solved by using simple
  data types with functions.

\**\s Q: Do the cost of modeling every problem with objects really
  makes up for the potential lost of composibility?

--
\**\s Both should have a place in our toolbox, (Scala \bðŸ˜ƒ \s).

---
\gScala is a pure OO language (everything is an object)

/\b-\s

--

```
val b = true                     // no primitive types
assert(b.toString == "true")

val i = if (b) 5 else 6          // everything is expression
assert(i.toString == "5")

val j = List(1,2,3)              // val means immutable
assert(j.length == 3)

val date = new java.util.Date()  // java interop
```

---
\gJava style classes

/\b-\s

```
class Stack[T] {
   var elems: List[T] = List()  // var means mutable
   def push(x: T) { elems = x :: elems }
   def top: T = elems.head
   def pop() { elems = elems.tail }
}

val stack = new Stack[Int]
```

---
\gObject (singleton)

/\b-\s

```
object Stack {
   def nickname = "LIFO"
}

Stack.nickname
```

---
\gTraits

/\b-\s

--
```
abstract class Hero {
  def fighting: String
  def slogan: String = s"I keep the world safe by $fighting bad guys"
}

trait Gun { def fighting: String = "shooting" }
trait Knife { def fighting: String = "stubbing" }
```

--
```
class HeroWithGun extends Hero with Gun {}
class HeroWithGunAndKnife extends Hero with Gun with Knife {}  // multi-inheritance
```

--
```
val heroWithGun = new Hero with Gun // mixin

```

--
\**\s traits is the combination of interface and mixins

---
\gFunction are objects

/\b-\s

```
def multiIA(x: Int) = i * x
val multiIB = (x: Int) => i * x
assert(multiIA(2) == 10)
assert(multiIA(2) == multiIB(2))
```

--
```
val multiIC = new Function1[Int, Int] {
  def apply(x: Int): Int = i * x
}
assert(multiIB(2) == multiIC(2))
```

---
\gThe \yapply\s method

/\b-\s

```
class Multiply(y: Int) {
   def apply(x: Int) = x * y
}

val multi5 = new Multiply(5)
assert(multi5(10) == 50)
```

--
\**\s \yapply\s closes the gap between functions and objects.

---
\gPartial functions

/\b-\s

```
val one: PartialFunction[Int, String] = { case 1 => "one" }
```

--
```
val two: PartialFunction[Int, String] = { case 2 => "two" }
```

--
```
val rest: PartialFunction[Int, String] = {
   case 3 => "three"
   case _ => "rest..."
}
```

--
```
val all: PartialFunction[Int, String] = one orElse two orElse rest
```

---
\gPattern matching

/\b-\s

\*Pattern matching is very sweet...\s

--
```
3 match {
  case 1 => "one"
  case 2 => "two"
  case 3 => "three"
  case _ => "rest..."
}
```

--
\*and it is the sugar for\s

```
all(3)
```

---
\gPattern matching (cont.)

/\b-\s

\**\s What is pattern matching, really
--
  \*-\s deconposition of a data type
--
  \*-\s apply partial function

--
\**\s Why pattern matching is ubiquitous in FP, but not OOP
--
  \*-\s FP focus on algebraic data types, decomposition is natural.
--
  \*-\s OOP focus on objects, no \ystandard\s way to decompose.

---
\gPattern matching (cont.)

/\b-\s

--
```
val helloWorldWithTuple = ("hello", "world") match {
   case (a, b) => s"$a, $b"
}
```

--
```
val some5: Option[Int] = Some(5)
val none: Option[Int] = None

some5 match {
   case Some(v) => s"value is $5"
   case None    => "no value!"
}
```

---
\gPattern match on "regular class"

/\b-\s
       
--
```
class Person(val name: String, val gender: String, val title: String) {}
```

--
```
val person = new Person("obama", "male", "president")
```

--
```
object Person {
  def unapply(p: Person) = Some((p.name, p.title))
}
```

--
```
person match {
  case Person(name, title) => println(s"name: $name, title: $title")
}
```

---
\gCase classes

/\b-\s

--
```
case class Country(capital: String, population: Double)
```

--
```
val sweden = Country("Gothenburg", 9.593)
```

--
```
sweden match {
  case Country(capital, population) =>
     println(s"capital: $capital :P, population: $population million")
}
```

--
```
Country.unapply(sweden)
```

---
\gAlgebraic data types

/\b-\s

--
\**\s FP mostly work with algebraic data types, which is formed by
  combining other types.

--
\**\s Case classes is one way to combine othe types (\yproduct types\s)

--
\**\s Case classes togther with traits can define \ysum types\s.

```
sealed trait Tree
case class Leaf(value: Int) extends Tree
case class Node(left: Tree, right: Tree) extends Tree
```

--
```
val tree = Node(
  Node(
    Leaf(20),
    Leaf(30)
  ),
  Leaf(10)
)
```

--
\**\s Algebraic data types \rðŸ’š \s pattern matching

```
def sum(tree: Tree): Int = tree match {
  case Node(left, right) => sum(left) + sum(right)
  case Leaf(value) => value
}
```

---
\gCollection utilities

/\b-\s

--
\**\s A list of basketball players

```
case class Player(name: String, team: String, ppg: Double)

val players = List(
  Player("Russel Westbrook", "Thunder",    23.7),
  Player("Kevin Durant",     "Thunder",    28.0),
  Player("Stephen Curry",    "Warriors",   30.0),
  Player("Klay Thompson",    "Warriors",   22.7),
  Player("Lebron James",     "Caveliers",  25.0),
  Player("Kevin Love",       "Caveliers",  17.9),
  Player("James Harden",     "Rockets",    28.6),
  Player("Dwight Howard",    "Rockets",    14.0)
)

```

--
```
val superstars = players.filter(_.ppg > 20.0)
```

--
```
val firstNames = players.map(_.name.split(" ")(0))
```

--
```
val groupByTeam = players.groupBy(_.team)
```

--
```
def totalPoints(players: List[Player]) = players.foldLeft(0.0) {
  (acc, player) => acc + player.ppg
}
```

--
```
// Rank teams based on superstar power
players
  .filter(_.ppg > 20.0)
  .groupBy(_.team)
  .map { case (team, ps) => (team, totalPoints(ps)) }
  .toList
  .sortBy(_._2)
```

---
\gProgramming against little boxes of things

/\b-\s

--
```
val responseA: Option[Int] = Some(5)
```
--
```
val (responseB, responseC, responseD) = (Some(6), Some(7), None)
```

--
```
val responseE = responseA.map(_ + 1)
```
--
```
val responseF = responseA.flatMap { x => Some(1+x) }
assert(responseE == responseF)
```

--
```
val sumABC = if(responseA.isDefined && responseB.isDefined && responseC.isDefined) {
  responseA.get + responseB.get + responseC.get
} else None
```

--
```
val sumABC = responseA.flatMap { a =>
   responseB.flatMap { b =>
      responseC.map { c =>
         a + b + c
      }
   }
}
```

--
```
val sumABC2 = for {
  a <- responseA
  b <- responseB
  c <- responseC
} yield a + b + c
```

---
\gProgramming against little boxes of things (cont.)

/\b-\s

--
```
import scala.concurrent.Future
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

val future1 = Future { 1 }
val future2 = Future { 2 }
val future3 = Future { 3 }
```

--
```
val future4 = future1.map(_ + 1)
```
--
```
val future5 = future1.flatMap { x => Future {1+x} }
```

--
```
val futureSum = for {
  v1 <- future1
  v2 <- future2
  v3 <- future3
} yield v1 + v2 + v3
```

---
\gBoxes that contain other boxes

/\b-\s

--
\**\s What if future contains options (\yOptionT\s)

--
\**\s More layers of boxes is kind of similiar to complex objects in
  OOP, making the program hard to understand, modify and maintain.

---
\gWrap up

/\b-\s

--
\**\s We \rðŸ’š \s Scala because:
--
  \*-\s It tries to implement one programming paradigm on top of
    another, therefore provides a lot of insights.

--
  \*-\s More tools and especially more views of the world is helpful
    to build better software.

--
  \*-\s Scala offers many ways of doing things and because the world
    \*is\s a complex place, this is not always a bad thing
    (e.g. concurrency in Scala)


--
\**\s Many more to explore: \yimplicits\s, \ylazy evaluation\s, \ycall\s
  \yby name\s, \ymacros\s, etc
